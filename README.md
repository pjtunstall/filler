This is my attempt at the [01Edu version](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/filler) // [01Founders version](https://learn.01founders.co/intra/london/div-01/filler) of the exercise. This version seems essentially the same as the [42 School version](https://github.com/VBrazhnik/Filler/blob/master/filler.en.pdf), apart from trivial differences in the names (42 School "plateau" versus 01Edu "Anfield" for the board) and symbols:

```
| Meaning              | 01Edu | 42 School |
|----------------------|-------|-----------|
| Player 1             |   @   |     O     |
| Player 2             |   $   |     X     |
| Player 1 latest move |   a   |     o     |
| Player 2 latest move |   s   |     x     |
| Empty                |   .   |     .     |
| New piece            |   *   |     *     |
```

But their instructions are worth reading as they clarify some points that are left ambiguous by ours. See especially the more extended example of gameplay in Â§V.4.3, p. 11.

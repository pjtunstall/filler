[01Edu version](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/filler) // [01Founders version](https://learn.01founders.co/intra/london/div-01/filler). These seem essentially the same as the [42 School version](https://github.com/VBrazhnik/Filler/blob/master/filler.en.pdf), apart from trivial differences in the names and symbols. But their instructions clarify some points that are left ambiguous by ours. See especially the more extended example of gameplay.

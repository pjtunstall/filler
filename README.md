## Context

This project is an implementation of the [01Edu version](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/filler) of an exercise called filler. The challenge is to create a bot that can compete against others in a game of placing variously shapes on a rectangular playing area. We're given several executable files: a so-called "game engine" and four AI opponents. When run with the appropriate command-line arguments, the game engine will run the student bot together with one of the given bots. It will send random shapes (like generalized Tetris shapes) to each bot in turn along with the current state of the board. The bot must place this shape on the board in such a way that precisely one cell (character) of the new shape overlaps with one of the shapes it placed previously, thus increasing its territory. It mustn't overlap any cell of any of the opponent's territory.

Points are awarded for every shape placed. The instructions don't say whether shapes are worth equal points.

A small technicality, which I'll just mention here to clarify the terminology, is that the shape that a bot receives is actually sent embedded in a rectangle as in the following examples. The rectangle is referred to as a piece. The instructions offer the following examples of pieces.

```
Piece 2 2:
.#
#.

Piece 5 4:
.##..
.##..
..#..
...#.

Piece 6 3:
.##...
###...
#..#..
```

To place a piece, a bot writes its coordinates (i.e., we must infer, the coordinates of its top left corner) to stdout, separated by a space and followed by a newline.

Eventually one of the players will run out of space and should then make an illegal move: "If your robot can't place anymore peaces\[sic\] he should still return a result (even if invalid), our robots for example return `0 0\\n`, when they can't place any more pieces." The instructions don't sepcify whether this forced invalid move has to be correctly formatted at least, or within the bounds of the board, although perhaps this is implicit in the audit question "Can you confirm that the project runs correctly?" If one player crashes or fails to send anything till the game engine imposes an unspecified timeout, they lose and the game ends there.

The challenge is to defeat three of the given robots on at least four out of five games. Bonus marks are to be had for defeating the most formidable opponent, terminator.

## Versions

This project is my attempt at the [01Edu version](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/filler) // [01Founders version](https://learn.01founders.co/intra/london/div-01/filler) of the exercise, which is the same as the [42 School version](https://github.com/VBrazhnik/Filler/blob/master/filler.en.pdf), apart from trivial differences: 42 School calls the board "plateau", while 01Edu calls it "Anfield", and different symbols are used for the territories of the two players and their latest moves. (I found the 42 School instructions worth reading too, though, as they're more detailed than those of 01Edu--see especially the longer example of gameplay in Â§V.4.3, p. 11--and randomly contain a list of the Seven Deadly Sins, complete with Biblical quotations to keep you on the right track!)

```
| Meaning              |  01Edu  | 42 School |
|----------------------|---------|-----------|
| Player 1             |    @    |     O     |
| Player 2             |    $    |     X     |
| Player 1 latest move |    a    |     o     |
| Player 2 latest move |    s    |     x     |
| Empty                |    .    |     .     |
| New piece            |    O    |     *     |
```

Regarding the 01Edu new-piece symbol, the shape cells of the three example pieces in the [pieces](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/filler#the-pieces) section are all denoted by '#', but those of the example piece in the [Usage](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/filler#usage) section by 'O' (uppercase letter after 'N'). At first, I guessed that the 'O' in the Usage example might be an accidental relic of an earlier version where Player 1's symbol was 'O', as in the 42 School instructions. But, on running the game engine, I see that 01Edu's current Linux game engine currently uses 'O', not '#', for its new-piece symbol.

## Usage

Open a terminal, clone this repository, and navigate into the root of the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pjtunstall/filler
cd filler
```

Download the docker_image folder as a zip file [here](https://assets.01-edu.org/filler/filler.zip) from the 01Edu public repo. To suppress the warning `JSONArgsRecommended: JSON arguments recommended for ENTRYPOINT to prevent unintended behavior related to OS signals (line 11)` that would otherwise appear when you build the container, change the final line of the Dockerfile from

```Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT /bin/bash
```

to

```Dockerfile
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

Compile the binaries for my bot and visualizer:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Move or copy them to `docker_file`, noting that the unzipped folder would have been called `filler` but needs some distinguishing mark to make it different from the project folder. On Linux, at least, a final `.` was supplied automatically.

```sh
cp mv target/release/filler ../filler./docker_image/solution/
cp target/release/visualizer ../filler./docker_image/
```

Optionally, copy the launch script there too:

```sh
cp launch.sh filler./docker_image/
```

This will let you run the container with `./launch.sh`, as a convenience, instead of having to type the elaborate run command in the code block that follows.

Navigate into the `docker_image` folder, then build and run the docker container:

```sh
cd filler./docker_image
docker build -t filler .
docker run -v "$(pwd)/solution":/filler./solution -it filler
```

You should now be in a shell session inside the container. To run a game, choose a map and two opponents, e.g. to pit my bot against their terminator:

```sh
./linux_game_engine -f maps/map01 -p1 solution/filler -p2 linux_robots/terminator
```

To run with the visualizer, exit docker and, on a host machine terminal, enter:

```sh
./linux_game_engine -f maps/map01 -p1 solution/filler -p2 linux_robots/terminator | ./visualizer
```

You can add a scale argument after visualizer, thus: `./visualizer 10`. The default, if you don't specify a scale, is 20.

## Questions

### Can pieces be rotated?

Apparently not. There's no way to express it to the game engine.

### Exit strategy

Should one's bot exit after playing its final move? No.

### Negative coordinates

Sometimes it might be necessary for a player to send negative numbers as the coordinates of the piece (i.e. its top-left cell). Not all legitimate moves can be expressed otherwise, given the possibility of pieces such as

```
Piece 5 4:
.##..
.##..
..#..
...#.
```

Are negative coordinates accepted by the game engine? The instructions are silent on this point. It seems that the given bot terminator chooses invalid coordinates rather than negative ones, as can be seen by trying this random seed.

```
./linux_game_engine -f maps/map01 -p2 solution/filler -p1 linux_robots/terminator -s 1749393971253574634

```

I did wonder if the audit requirement to change "the position of the players each time so that the student player can be the p1 and the p2" was meant to ensure that players have a roughly similar chance of getting stuck on the first move.

And yet, negative coordinates are admitted! Swapping the labels of the two players in the example above and having one's own bot move output 4 -1 for the first move allows it to place

```
.....
.....
.....
.....
OOO..
OO...
```

on its initial cell, 4 3.

### Botton-right rules

Can empty cells of pieces exceed the bottom or right edges of the Anfield, just as they can be negative? Can nonempty cells do so?

## Todo

- Allow negative cordinates, being careful to avooid out-of-bounds errors.
- Allow pieces to be placed in such a way that at least their empty cells go off the right or bottom edge if that's allowed.
  - Likewise nonempty cells if that's possible; check it.
- Write tests.
- Beat Terminator.
